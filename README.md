# Smart Irrigation System Using IoT and Machine Learning
ðŸš€ Developed during an internship at NIT Trichy

# Project Overview
This project focuses on an automated irrigation system that leverages IoT sensors and machine learning to optimize water usage in agriculture. The system collects real-time environmental data and predicts irrigation needs using the Random Forest algorithm.

# Key Features
ðŸ“¡ IoT-based Sensors: Measures soil moisture, temperature, air humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and pH.
ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Prediction: Uses Random Forest to determine whether irrigation is required.
ðŸŒ± Crop-Based Optimization: Adapts to different plant or crop requirements.
ðŸ“Š Data Logging: Stores sensor data for future analysis and improvements.
# Tech Stack Used
IoT: Arduino with sensors (TinkerCAD simulation)
Machine Learning: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
Data Processing: Jupyter Notebook
Cloud Storage: Firebase (optional)
